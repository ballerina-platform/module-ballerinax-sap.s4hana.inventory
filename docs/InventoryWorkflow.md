# Inventory Management Workflow Using SAP APIs

The workflow for managing inventory using SAP APIs begins with an initial stock check to determine the available stock count in the inventory. This is done by using the Material Stock API `(sap.s4hana.api_material_stock_srv)` to retrieve the current stock levels for the materials of interest. Knowing the current stock levels is essential before creating any material movements or reservations.

Once the stock levels are determined, reservations can be made if required. This is achieved by using the Reservation Document API `(sap.s4hana.api_reservation_document_srv)`, which allows for the creation of a Reservation Document. For example, if there is a need to reserve 100 units of a specific material for a production order, this API facilitates that reservation, ensuring the material is allocated for the intended purpose.

Following the reservation, any goods movements, such as receipts or issues, need to be recorded. This is done by creating a Material Document using the Material Documents API `(sap.s4hana.api_material_document_srv)`. For instance, recording a goods issue of 50 units of a material or a goods receipt of 200 units is managed through this API, ensuring all movements are logged accurately.

After a certain period, it is crucial to prepare for a physical inventory count. This involves creating a Physical Inventory Document using the Physical Inventory Documents API `(sap.s4hana.api_physical_inventory_doc_srv)`. This document helps manage and track the physical inventory, creating a record for counting and verification purposes. It includes the physical stock counts that are available in the warehouse.

The next step involves reconciliation and verification. By cross-checking the counts in the Physical Inventory Documents with the amounts retrieved using the Material Stock API `(sap.s4hana.api_material_stock_srv)` , any abnormalities, discrepancies, or potential thefts can be identified and investigated. This process ensures the integrity of the inventory records and helps in maintaining accurate stock levels.

This overall workflow ensures efficient management of inventory, accurate tracking of material movements, and regular verification of physical stock to maintain integrity and prevent losses.
